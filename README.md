CTR RNA-seq teaching
This course is going to happen in 5th July, 2018. And we will generally teach the undergraduate RNA-seq data analysis.
The data we would like to use is from the following publication
     https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-018-0165-y.
There are 39 RNA-seq data, which ones will we plan to use for teaching? (Not decided yet)
We will teach from general quality control for RNA-seq to the differential gene expression analysis.
